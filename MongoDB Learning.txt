The Ultimate MongoDB Aggregation Guide: Make Your Queries Soar in One Video

Core Aggregation Concepts
🔍MongoDB aggregation is a pipeline operation that transforms data through multiple stages, grouping documents based on specified expressions.
🛠️The aggregate method takes a pipeline argument (array of operations) and an options argument, including explain and query allow disk use for intermediate storage.
Key Operators
📊The $group operator creates new documents for each unique value of a specified field, enabling grouping of data like teachers by age.
🔎$match filters documents based on conditions, allowing selection of specific subsets like male teachers for further processing.
🧮$sum increments values by one for each document in a group, useful for counting items like teachers in age groups.
Advanced Techniques
🔀$unwind unwraps nested arrays, creating separate documents for each element, facilitating operations on array fields like hobbies.
📏$size determines array length, useful for counting items like total hobbies, with $ifNull handling null cases by returning empty arrays.
📈$avg calculates averages of specified fields, applicable to scenarios like finding mean age or scores across collections.
Complex Queries
🔗Chaining multiple operators in a pipeline enables complex data processing, such as grouping unwound hobbies to count students per hobby.
🎯Combining $match with aggregation operators allows targeted analysis, like calculating average scores for students over 20 years old.
